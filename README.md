## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
ul li::before {
  content: 'â€¢'; /* Bullet character */
  color: var(--color-Nutmeg); /* Color of the bullet */
  position: absolute;
  font-size: 20px; /* Larger bullet */
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;

  left: 0;
}

ol {
  counter-reset: list-counter; /* Creates a counter for ordered list */
}

ol li::before {
  counter-increment: list-counter; /* Increments the counter */
  content: counter(list-counter) '.'; /* Displays the counter */
  color: var(--color-Nutmeg); /* Color of the number */
  position: absolute;
  font-size: 16px; /* Larger number */
  font-weight: 700;
  left: 0;
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue studying responsive CSS and animation, transitions and FX like parallax.
